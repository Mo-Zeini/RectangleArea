# RectangleArea
This program calculates the area of a rectangle.

The subclass, Perimeter, has the constructor that calls the constructor in the superclass using "super()."
Also, it calculates the perimeter by getting the values of the sides that were declared in the superclass using “super.”
Furthermore, it has the setter method that sets the name of a rectangle.

Inside it, I assigned its parameter to the instance variable, which has the same name, using "this."

Finally, it returns the values of the perimeter and the name variables.

On the other side, the superclass, RectangleArea, has the declared variables, side1, side2, and area, that are used to calculate the area of a rectangle
inside the constructor and return their values.
Also, it has the main method that has the implementations of displaying the name of a rectangle, its area, and its perimeter and creating the subclass object.

Inside the constructor, I assigned the parameters side1 and side2 to instance variables, which have the same name, using "this"
to tell the computer that on the left side are the instance variables.
